All code is in C++. I implemented every command as per the spec. Teleport is now on 'g'. 
Damage and speed stats are updated correctly by items. SpongeBob dying is the win condition.
How I handled some of the failures of commands:

't'ake off an item doesn't work if your carry slots are filled.
'd'rop item doesn't work if there is an item underneath the pc.
If one tries to select a slot, be it equipment or in the inventory and there is no item there,
an error message appears for a brief moment at the top of the screen.
